  summary: WebP image library
  description: |
    WebP is a method of lossy and lossless compression that can be used on a large variety of photographic,
    translucent and graphical images found on the web. The degree of lossy compression is adjustable so a
    user can choose the trade-off between file size and image quality.
    libwebp-base provides the headers and shared libraries. For cwebp and dwep,
    binaries install libwebp.
